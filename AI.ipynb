            "text/markdown": "> Since you're allergic to peanuts, we'll focus on a peanut-free bulking plan.  Bulking requires a calorie surplus, meaning you need to consume more calories than you burn.  Here's a general approach, but remember to consult a doctor or registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes, especially with allergies. They can help tailor a plan to your specific needs and ensure it's safe given your allergy.\n> \n> **1. Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):**\n> \n> Several online calculators can estimate your BMR and TDEE based on your age, weight, height, and activity level.  Use one of these to get a starting point.  For bulking, you'll need to add 250-500 calories to your TDEE.  This surplus is crucial for muscle growth.\n> \n> **2. Macronutrient Ratio:**\n> \n> Aim for a macronutrient ratio that supports muscle growth:\n> \n> * **Protein:** 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (that's 115-158 grams for you).  This is crucial for muscle repair and growth.  Good sources include chicken breast, turkey, fish, lean beef, eggs, Greek yogurt, beans, lentils, and whey or casein protein powder (check for peanut-free options).\n> * **Carbohydrates:**  Approximately 40-50% of your total calories.  Carbs provide energy for your workouts. Choose complex carbs like brown rice, quinoa, oats, sweet potatoes, and whole-wheat bread.\n> * **Fats:**  Approximately 20-30% of your total calories.  Healthy fats are essential for hormone production.  Good sources include avocados, olive oil, nuts (excluding peanuts!), seeds, and fatty fish.\n> \n> **3. Sample Meal Plan (Adjust based on your calorie needs):**\n> \n> This is a *sample* and needs adjusting based on your calculated calorie needs and preferences:\n> \n> * **Breakfast:** Oatmeal with berries and a scoop of peanut-free protein powder, eggs.\n> * **Lunch:** Chicken breast salad (with quinoa or brown rice), mixed vegetables.\n> * **Snack:** Greek yogurt with fruit and seeds.\n> * **Dinner:**  Lean beef stir-fry with brown rice and plenty of vegetables.\n> * **Snack:**  A handful of almonds or other peanut-free nuts/seeds.\n> \n> **4. Strength Training:**\n> \n> Bulking without strength training is less effective. Aim for a 3-4 day per week weight training program focusing on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows) that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously.  Include adequate rest between sets and workouts.\n> \n> **5. Track your Progress:**\n> \n> Monitor your weight, body measurements, and strength gains regularly.  Adjust your calorie intake and training accordingly.  If you're not gaining weight or muscle, increase your calorie surplus slightly.\n> \n> **6. Hydration and Sleep:**\n> \n> Drink plenty of water throughout the day and aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.  Both are essential for recovery and muscle growth.\n> \n> **7. Allergy Awareness:**\n> \n> * **Always carefully check food labels:**  Hidden peanut ingredients are a real risk.\n> * **Carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen):**  Be prepared for a severe allergic reaction.\n> * **Inform others about your allergy:**  Let anyone preparing your food know about your allergy.\n> \n> \n> **Important Considerations:**\n> \n> * **Listen to your body:** If you experience any digestive discomfort, adjust your diet.\n> * **Consistency is key:**  Stick to your plan as consistently as possible for optimal results.\n> * **Consult professionals:**  A registered dietitian can help create a personalized meal plan, and a personal trainer can design a safe and effective workout program.\n> \n> \n> This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute medical advice.  Remember to consult with healthcare professionals before starting any new diet or exercise program, particularly given your peanut allergy.\n"
